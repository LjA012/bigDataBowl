## Purpose
For the capstone project in my Data Science Program, I decided to work on a Kaggle Competition.  https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020.  In short, the competition is sponsored by the NFL and the objective is to see how accurate one can predict the yards a running back will gain after getting the handoff - given 49 features in the dataset.
