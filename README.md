## Purpose
For the capstone project in my Data Science Program, I decided to work on a Kaggle Competition.  https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020.  In short, the competition is sponsored by the NFL and the objective is to see how accurate one can predict the yards a running back will gain after getting the handoff - given 49 features in the dataset. 

## Data
The data consisted of every run play (where a handoff was There were 509,762 rows

## Data Cleaning
I spent a large chunk of time getting to know the data and understanding all of the different values for each feature.  For example, the 'GameWeather' feature had so many differnt inputs because of spelling mistakes and no uniform method to input this data.  Inputs like 'Sunny and clear skies' and 'Sun' mean the same thing, but my model would not know that - so that is why the cleaning process was extensive, for all 49 features.
